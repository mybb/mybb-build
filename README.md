# mybb-build
The MyBB package build script. **Requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).**

A Docker image [is built](https://github.com/mybb/mybb-build/blob/master/Dockerfile) with tools needed to run the [Phing](https://www.phing.info/) build [script](https://github.com/mybb/mybb-build/blob/master/build.xml).

#### Directory Structure
- `input/source/` - directory containing development source files (e.g. a git repository),
- `input/previous-source/` - directory containing source files of the previous release,
- `input/patches/` - directory containing git patch/diff files to be applied,
- `input/package-addendum/` - additional files attached to the release package,
- `input/build.properties` - variables specific to the target release.
- `secrets/`, `secrets.env` - runtime keys and secrets used to fetch additional files

## Building Packages

**It is recommended to run the tools with at least 2048 MB of memory available to PHP and external tools.**

1. #### Clone the Builder
   Clone/download the repository. Make sure old files in `input/` are removed.

2. #### Prepare Docker Image
   Build the Docker image in the cloned directory:

   ```
   $ docker-compose build
   ```

3. #### Prepare Input Files
   For reproducing packages, use the provided `input/` content.

   For building from scratch:
   - Adjust `input/build.properties` values.
   - If applicable, place additional files that can be fetched automatically from a data repository at branch specified in `input/build.properties`:

     1. Create a `secrets.env` file in the main directory with the data repository URL variable:

        ```
        INPUT_FILES_REPOSITORY=git@github.com/mybb/...
        ```

     2. Create a Deploy key and add/ask to add it to the data repository and place the private key file (`id_ed25519`, `id_rsa`, etc.) in `secrets/`. Files within this directory will be copied into the container and configured as a SSH key to use when pulling data in the `remote-data` task.

4. #### Build Packages
   Run the built `phing` service and execute:
   - the `dist-set` task to build the release package only:

     ```
     $ docker-compose run phing dist-set
     ```

   - the `full` task to build the release and update packages:

     ```
     $ docker-compose run phing full
     ```

If you believe you found discrepancies when reproducing packages, [contact the MyBB security team](https://mybb.com/get-involved/security/).

## Build Environment

The built `phing` service, with volumes `input/` and `output/` mounted to `/home/user/`, passes subsequent `docker-compose run` arguments to `phing` (the PHP build script).

During Phing execution the files operated on are located in the `build/` directory, and once all tasks are completed are copied to `output/` (outside of the Docker container).

#### VirtualBox Shared Folders on Windows hosts
On Windows-based hosts it may be necessary to add the directory in the Docker Machine's **Settings â†’ Shared Folders** (e.g. `d:\mybb-build` named `d/mybb-build`) and manually mount the VirtualBox Shared Folders filesystem (`vboxsf`) to the `default` machine:
```
$ docker-machine ssh default 'sudo mount -t vboxsf d/mybb-build //d/mybb-build'
$ docker-machine restart
```
